The following task is implemented: 

There is a client.
The client can have any number of cards.
A card has three fields: CVV code, card number, and the balance on the card.
Display a message on the screen indicating how many identical cards the client has.
The field containing the card balance should not be included in the comparison.
In other words, two cards with the same CVV codes and card numbers but different balances are considered identical.
Provide for various output message scenarios, such as when the client has no cards at all, when the client has no duplicate cards, and other possible situations.
